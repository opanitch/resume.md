  <p>As a highly experienced UX Developer with 10 years experience, I've seen a wide variety of projects and development stacks. What I have worked on ranges from personal websites to enterprise-class web applications, utilizing a combination of ingenuity, developer tools, and front-end frameworks. My recent experience involves React / Redux, Typescript, and Tailwind, using an Enzyme / Jest testing suite, running in a Node.js / npm environment.</p>

  <p>Other relevant code experience includes HTML, CSS3 / LESS / SASS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, JAVA (JSP / JSTL), Lovelace, YAML, JSON, Bash, Gulp, and WordPress</p>

  <h3><span>UI Engineer IV</span>, <span>June 2018 to December 2020</span></h3>

  <h4><span>Comcast - xFi</span> <span>Philadelphia, PA</span></h4></h4>

  <p>As a contracted member of Comcast’s xFi Team, I had the privilege of working on Syndicating one of the flagship Xfinity App offerings. Originally built on the Polymer framework and a Redux architecture, Comcast had around 1 million installed users at the time I started. Using a combination of build processes involving Webpack, gulp, and Node, I helped create an assets library and architecture to support multiple Syndication Partners. Once the assets were prepared, I helped configure our Jenkins pipeline using YAML mortal files to run all our build steps and tests, and then publish to an OpenCloud instance. The build process accepts a variable to designate which assets and themes to use, enabling Comcast’s xFi platform to run in 4 different countries, 4 languages, and 22 million more potential users. After the second official partner launch, the team was reassigned and became the Coverage Team, which oversaw pre-mesh Self-service WiFi and the React Migration. I used Polymer 1, React, Redux, and Webpack to re-architect the xFi project and lay the proper pattern foundations. After the Self WiFi work was completed, I was assigned to the Web Infrastructure team, where I used React, Typescript, Tailwind, and our Webpack config to continue implementing the React migration and architecture-level updates to our Dev Tools. Once Polymer became a fallback framework, we were able to optimize our load bundles and assets. This, along with Tailwind and strict implementation of Typing, reduced load-time from initial request to ready by 10 seconds on our heaviest page. Working on this team allowed me to grow my code knowledge, understand the far-reaching implications of project architecture, and take the lead on implementing critical tools needed to develop a modern web application.<br />

  <h3><span>UI Engineer III</span>, <span>June 2016 to May 2018</span></h3>

  <h4><span>Comcast Business - My Account</span> <span>Philadelphia, PA</span></h4>

  <p>As a contractor, I joined the Comcast Business team through Comcast’s Front-end Development (FED) department. As a member of FED, I helped to drive innovation and modern standards in User Interface (UI) development on top of the regular project work of the Comcast Business department to which I was assigned. About a year later, the FED department was split up and I assumed a leading role in the Legacy My Account application UI and Site Unification effort. We used a Microsoft stack of .Net / Razor backend, Sitecore content management system (CMS), and a Node.js / Gulp / SASS driven Front End using KnockoutJS for dynamic UI changes and Pattern Lab for templating. After the Site Unification ReArch project, I was assigned to another team to accrue experience using a React / Redux using JavaScript (JS) ES6 workflow that was going to be the standard for all new projects. Working in a modern and well-structured environment allowed me to learn better JS coding conventions, modular/componentized architecture and pattern development, and debugging methods.<br />

  <h3><span>Team Lead, Front-End UX Development</span>, <span>June 2013 to April 2016</span></h3>

  <h4><span>True Action/eBay Enterprise</span> <span>King of Prussia, PA</span></h4>

  <p>I started at True Action as a contractor as the company began its reorganization and rebranding effort after being bought by eBay in 2011. I began working on Global Sports Inc’s JAVA based v9/v10 platform where I worked on large brands such as Dick’s Sporting Goods, Speedo, iRobot, and many more. Projects ranged in scope from small content updates to feature additions including product page zooms and Express Shop overlays, and redesigns including everything from page redesigns to whole brand redesigns. Approximately 6 months after my employment as a contractor, I became a full time employee of the company and was promoted to the lead position of my team. Besides development work, my expanded responsibilities included estimating the time and scope of all the projects submitted to my team, coordinating workload bandwidth with project managers, meeting with technical account managers and clients, and assisting the other developers on the team with their work. I acquired familiarity with new languages like JAVA, XML and SASS while maintaining proficiency with older JavaScript libraries such as Prototype and jQuery 1.6 (and older), as these were also common place among client sites that had not been updated in years. Expanded knowledge of these languages honed my ability to find and squash the worst of display bugs, especially in IE7.<br />

  <h3><span>Web Developer</span>, <span>July 2011 to May 2013</span></h3>

  <h4><span>The Brownstein Group</span> <span>Philadelphia, PA</span></h4>

  <p>The Brownstein Group is a highly recognized advertising agency in center city Philadelphia with a client list that includes notable businesses like IKEA, Microsoft, Comcast, and Einstein Healthcare Network. While at Brownstein, I created multiple weeks of mobile advertisements using Adobe Flash. These included static animation banners as well as fully interactive experiences. I created multiple micro-sites for clients like IKEA for several of their campaigns, and even created a Facebook page for their brand. These pages ranged in difficulty from single page sites to a fully interactive website that hosted a branded web series. I also coded many email blasts that are sent out for weekly or seasonal sales. While employed at Brownstein, I focused on my work in JavaScript and the extensive jQuery library.<br />
