<h3><span>UI Engineer IV</span>, <span>June 2018 to December 2020</span></h3>
<h4><span>Comcast - xFi</span> <span>Philadelphia, PA</span></h4>
<p>As a contracted member of Comcast’s xFi Team, I had the privilege of working on Syndicating one of the flagship Xfinity App offerings. Originally built on the Polymer framework and a Redux architecture, Comcast had around 1 million installed users at the time I started. Using a combination of build processes involving Webpack, gulp, and Node, I helped create an assets library and architecture to support multiple Syndication Partners. Once the assets were prepared, I helped configure our Jenkins pipeline using YAML mortal files to run all our build steps and tests, and then publish to an OpenCloud instance. The build process accepts a variable to designate which assets and themes to use, enabling Comcast’s xFi platform to run in 4 different countries, 4 languages, and 22 million more potential users. After the second official partner launch, the team was reassigned and became the Coverage Team, which oversaw pre-mesh Self-service WiFi and the React Migration. I used Polymer 1, React, Redux, and Webpack to re-architect the xFi project and lay the proper pattern foundations. After the Self WiFi work was completed, I was assigned to the Web Infrastructure team, where I used React, Typescript, Tailwind, and our Webpack config to continue implementing the React migration and architecture-level updates to our Dev Tools. Once Polymer became a fallback framework, we were able to optimize our load bundles and assets. This, along with Tailwind and strict implementation of Typing, reduced load-time from initial request to ready by 10 seconds on our heaviest page. Working on this team allowed me to grow my code knowledge, understand the far-reaching implications of project architecture, and take the lead on implementing critical tools needed to develop a modern web application.

<h3><span>UI Engineer III</span>, <span>June 2016 to May 2018</span></h3>
<h4><span>Comcast Business - My Account</span> <span>Philadelphia, PA</span></h4>
<p>As a contractor, I joined the Comcast Business team through Comcast’s Front-end Development (FED) department. As a member of FED, I helped to drive innovation and modern standards in User Interface (UI) development on top of the regular project work of the Comcast Business department to which I was assigned. About a year later, the FED department was split up and I assumed a leading role in the Legacy My Account application UI and Site Unification effort. We used a Microsoft stack of .Net / Razor backend, Sitecore content management system (CMS), and a Node.js / Gulp / SASS driven Front End using KnockoutJS for dynamic UI changes and Pattern Lab for templating. After the Site Unification ReArch project, I was assigned to another team to accrue experience using a React / Redux using JavaScript (JS) ES6 workflow that was going to be the standard for all new projects. Working in a modern and well-structured environment allowed me to learn better JS coding conventions, modular/componentized architecture and pattern development, and debugging methods.
